building a GPS handheld device that has higher accuracy due to using an additional IMU sensor module

-> when GPS signal is getting worse compensate with IMU data -> really good accuracy but without using a RTK or similar

## plan
- get GPS mdoule working
- get IMU module working
- write logic and formulas for calculating a position
- if time add a display (display will be added with case design)
